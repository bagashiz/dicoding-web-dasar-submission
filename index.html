				<h2>Projects</h2>
				<p>Most of my projects are related to back-end development, with a focus on RESTful web services and
					APIs. Here are some of my projects:</p>
				<section>
					<h3>Go POS</h3>
					<img src="assets/images/project-1.png" class="featured-image" alt="Go POS">
					<p>
						A simple RESTful Point of Sale (POS) web service written in Go programming language. This
						project is a part of my learning process in understanding Hexagonal Architecture in Go.
					</p>
					<p>
						It uses Gin as the HTTP framework and PostgreSQL as the database with pgx as the driver and
						Squirrel as the query builder. It also utilizes Redis as the caching layer with go-redis as the
						client.
					</p>
					<p>
						This project idea was inspired by the Ide Project untuk Upgrade Portfolio Backend Engineer video
						on YouTube by Asdita Prasetya, which provided valuable guidance and inspiration for its
						development.
					</p>

				<section>
					<h3>SEA Cinema Tix</h3>
					<img src="assets/images/project-2.png" class="featured-image" alt="SEA Cinema Tix">
					<p>This is a challenge project for the Compfest 15 Software Engineering Academy (SEA) program.</p>
					<p>
						The SEA Cinema Tix is a movie ticket booking web application developed to enhance the moviegoing
						experience for customers of SEA Cinema.
					</p>
					<p>
						Built with Laravel 10 Framework, TailwindCSS, and powered by a MySQL database, this application
						provides a seamless and efficient platform for users to browse movies, book tickets, and manage
						their reservations.
